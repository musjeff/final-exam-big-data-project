BIGDATA EXAM FINAL PROJECT

Names: MUSANA Jean Bosco

Id: 27133



This report is going to explain more about the project I have done including images. the source of the data set is 
1. WORLD BANK OPEN DATA

2.Fertility Rate (births per woman)
Dataset Title: Fertility rate(births per woman)

the link is provided here: https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.DYN.TFRT.IN

3.this also the Source is : World Bank Open Data
GDP per Capita

Dataset Title: GDP per capita (current US$)

also the link is provided here : https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.PCAP.CD










this image include the codes of importing libraries 
and there is the codes of installing the missing libraries
so as to make the emvironment work propery

1.here the codes were to make the fertility dataset a csv file
2.and also the gdp dataset are readable in csv
3.other codes were to show the general shape of each dataset
4. so we chose the year to work on and it is 2010
5.the following codes were to select the country names and rename some columns also we made the merging

1.this first code was to drop the null values and 
2.the following is to print the cleaned dataset and we display the first five data
that what head() mean

this was to describe the dataset so we ca see and understand it's Image
becouse it shows every thing


<img width="648" height="511" alt="Screenshot 2025-08-02 163018" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b274268b-c28b-47eb-9ae1-0b9d854e4d8f" />


those code were to spread data so we can see the statistics in the charts
shown below which shows the Fertility rate VS GDP per capita (2010) so here each dot represent a country



<img width="645" height="563" alt="Screenshot 2025-08-02 163108" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2617bee6-7c3b-41de-809b-516e4a99d16a" />



The statistics below shows the distribution of fertility rate and frequency
so we can understand it very well

there is the codes of predict and others are training axis


<img width="680" height="566" alt="Screenshot 2025-08-02 163330" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bb233a4a-3583-432d-8b8d-2a59f60c20b1" />



this was about perfomence



<img width="650" height="259" alt="Screenshot 2025-08-02 163514" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ca527ec1-1170-4c5f-bbde-99a5945f1d6c" />

these codes are comparing the fertility rate to GDP per capita as we can see the 
Linear regression

1. the code there in the image are saving the cleaned dataset and saving it' name
2. 2. the next is printing the message and it is displayed



<img width="670" height="172" alt="Screenshot 2025-08-02 163611" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d97dde22-efbe-40ab-b050-3f6466dff101" />



Insight in the scatter plot is "The scatter plot reveals a clear negative relationship between GDP per capita and fertility rates.
Wealthier countries (on the right side) generally have fewer children per woman, while poorer countries (on the left) tend to have larger families.
This pattern supports the idea that economic development is linked to lower fertility

1. Insight that I have gotten in fertility rate is " This chart shows the ten(10) countries with the highest fertility rates.
2.  Most of them are in Sub‑Saharan Africa, like Niger, Chad, and Mali, where women have an average of five(5) to seven(7) children each. This highlights regions where economic development and education levels are still low, contributing to higher birth rates"

 
 2.and about the GDP per capita "“Here we see the 10 countries with the highest GDP per capita.
These are mostly wealthy nations such as Luxembourg, Switzerland, and Norway, each with GDP per capita well above $50,000.
These countries typically have better access to healthcare, education, and family planning — which helps explain their lower fertility rates."
